# swan-trading-framework

The Swan Trading Framework currently works with the Oanda API. Looking to branch into the alpaca api soon once I finish developing for the oanda api. Will continue with updates and also update the README everytime.

## Folders to create 
Firstly, in the code base you may see an import like constant.account for example. This is the folder(which you can name whatever you like) that holds api keys, URLS , and other private stuff. Definitely create a folder that holds important info!

## API Folder 
The api folder contains connection points to the oanda api. This folder will grow with adding more api to connect too.

## Data Folder 
Stores all the downloaded data from the Oanda api. Also you get data from other source you deem fit for backtesting. Remeber the higher the quality of data you get. The better the result are well to me at least.
